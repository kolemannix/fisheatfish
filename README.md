fisheatfish
===========

The idea is to have a fish-tank simulation where all the fish in the tank battle each other for survival as an AI / concurrency programming exercise. Potential ideas / features include:
  Leveling - You can invest points in upgrading certain aspects of your fish's behavior or abilities to make him stronger
  Obstacles - Impassable objects and such
  Power ups - They power you up
  Various different AI modes for the different fish
